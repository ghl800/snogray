This short note gives the equation for a reflected ray as used in many
computer rendering applications, eg: ray tracing. Given a ray Ri
incident at a point on a surface with normal N one wishes to determine
the reflected ray from that point. The geometry and nomenclature is
given in the following diagram.

The result is determined by straightforward geometry as follows where
"." indicates the dot product and typically N and R1 are unit vectors.

   Rr = N (R1 . N) + a

and

   R1 + a = N (R1 . N)

so

   Rr = 2 N (R1 . N) - R1

If -Ri is substituted for R1 then we have

   Rr = Ri - 2 N (Ri . N)

Some obvious things to note at extreme cases. If Ri is parallel to the
normal then Rr = N, that is, the reflected ray is in the opposite
direction to the incident ray. If the incident ray is perpendicular to
the normal then it is unaffected, Rr = Ri, this is a glancing ray.

Note also that while the above diagram is in 2D, the equations hold for
any dimension.
