Parameters for rendering test scenes from Eric Haines' "Standard
Procedural Databases" (SPD) project.

   http://www.acm.org/pubs/tog/resources/SPD/

The SPD programs output scenes in "NFF" format by default, so can be
input to snogray standard input by using -Inff option.

The scenes are apparently rendered with a "built-in" gamma correction of
2.2, so need to use snogray -G2.2 option.  Also the lighting levels are
pretty much random, so use -L option as appropriate to adjust.

Note that the reference pictures on the website use povray, which by
default uses linear light falloff, not r-squared; snogray always uses
r-squared.


General invocation is like:

   ../spd3_13/teapot | snogray -Inff -G2.2 -s512x512 - /tmp/teapot.png


Here are lighting options for each scene, to match reference images:

   teapot	 (not needed)
   balls	 -L.15
   tetra	 -L3
   shells	 -L300
   mount	 -L300
   sombrero	 -L3


The "test:teapot" test scene also uses meshes generated by SPD; these
aren't included with the sources because the teapot mesh is very large.
To create them using an SPD distribution, assuming "../spd3_13" is the
directory the SPD distribution has been built in, use the following
commands:

   ../spd3_13/teapot -s 30 | nff-cvt -msh2 > teapot.msh

   ../spd3_13/teapot -s 8 | nff-cvt -msh0 > board1.msh

   ../spd3_13/teapot -s 8 | nff-cvt -msh1 > board2.msh
